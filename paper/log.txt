2015-08-02: Starting to "prettify" the semantics by hand

  (Because the automatic translator idea has not worked out yet. We
  may return to that idea later.)

2014-11-05: Prolog support

  Three possible Prolog implementations for Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install yap                  ; yap
    sudo apt-get install gprolog              ; gprolog
    sudo apt-get install swi-prolog-nox       ; swipl

  Possible tool for highliting code:
    sudo apt-get install python-pygments
    LaTex package: minted  http://ctan.uib.no/macros/latex/contrib/minted/minted.pdf
    \usepackage{minted}
    \inputminted{prolog}{semantics.pl}

2014-11-05: Paper skeleton

The semantics is currently a Prolog file in ../prolog/semantics.pl.
The appendix and perhaps also the main paper sections could include
parts genertaed from that file if we can (with small effort) make a
"prolog->LaTeX" converter. It might be good to start from this:
  https://hackage.haskell.org/package/NanoProlog
